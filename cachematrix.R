## These two functions can be used to set a matrix as input and get its inverse as output.
## If the inverse of the input matrix it's been already calculated (and the matrix is not changed) the inverse is
## read from the cache. Only squared invertible matrices are handled because the solve function is used underneath.

## makeCacheMatrix returns a list with four functions:
## - set		sets the current matrix receiving as parameter
## - get		gets the current matrix
## - setinverse	sets the inverted matrix
## - getinverse	gets the inverted matrix

## The user can create a special "matrix" object calling the makeCacheMatrix(originalMatrix)

## cacheSolve returns the inverse of the special "matrix" object specified as the input argument 
## reading it from cache if it's been already calculated and the matrix isn't changed 
## or calculating from scratch.

## This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse
## and returns a list of functions used to interact with the matrix object and its inverse
